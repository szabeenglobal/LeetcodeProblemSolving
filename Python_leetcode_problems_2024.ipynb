    "## Pointers in Different Types of Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, nodes can have various types and numbers of pointers depending on the data structure they belong to. Here are some common examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Singly Linked List Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: 1 pointer (next)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     Each node in a singly linked list contains a single pointer, usually called `next`, which points to the next node in the sequence. The last node’s `next` pointer points to `null` (or `None` in Python) to signify the end of the list.\n",
    "   - **Diagram**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [Data] -> [Next]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Doubly Linked List Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: 2 pointers (next, prev)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     A node in a doubly linked list contains two pointers: `next`, which points to the next node, and `prev`, which points to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.\n",
    "   - **Diagram**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [Prev] <-> [Data] <-> [Next]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Binary Tree Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: 2 pointers (left, right)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     In a binary tree, each node has two pointers: `left` and `right`. These pointers refer to the left and right child nodes, respectively. In a binary search tree (BST), nodes to the left contain values less than the parent, and nodes to the right contain values greater than the parent.\n",
    "   - **Diagram**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "       [Data]\n",
    "       /    \\\n",
    "     [Left] [Right]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **N-ary Tree Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: n pointers (children)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     An N-ary tree node can have up to `n` children. This is common in structures like general trees or in file system representations where nodes may have varying numbers of children.\n",
    "   - **Diagram** (for N = 3):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "       [Data]\n",
    "      /  |  \\\n",
    "    [C1][C2][C3]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Graph Node (or Vertex)**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: Variable number (depends on connections or edges)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     In an adjacency list representation of a graph, each graph node can have multiple pointers corresponding to each edge connecting it to other nodes. The number of pointers equals the node's degree (number of edges connected).\n",
    "   - **Diagram**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [Data] --> [Neighbor1] --> [Neighbor2] --> ... --> [NeighborN]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Skip List Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: Variable (next, multiple levels)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     Skip lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees. Each node may have multiple `next` pointers at different levels, allowing for faster search operations by \"skipping\" over multiple nodes.\n",
    "   - **Diagram** (with 3 levels):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [L3] -> [L2] -> [L1] -> [Data]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Trie (Prefix Tree) Node**\n",
    "   - **Pointers**: Fixed number based on the character set (e.g., 26 pointers for English alphabet)\n",
    "   - **Description**: \n",
    "     In a trie, each node represents a character in a word and may have up to a fixed number of pointers, often 26 for the English alphabet. Each pointer represents a possible character transition.\n",
    "   - **Diagram** (partial):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "       [A]\n",
    "      / | \\\n",
    "    [B][C][D]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Different data structures use varying numbers of pointers in nodes to maintain relationships between elements efficiently. Understanding these structures helps to choose the right data structure based on traversal and performance requirements."

    "\n",
    "1. **Handle \\( n = 0 \\):** If \\( n = 0 \\), the result is `1` since \\( x^0 = 1 \\) for any \\( x \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle Negative Exponents:** If \\( n \\) is negative, convert it to positive by taking the reciprocal of \\( x \\).\n",

    "3. **Exponentiation by Squaring:**\n",
    "   - If \\( n \\) is odd, multiply `result` by `current_product`.\n",
    "   - Square `current_product` to get the next higher power, and halve \\( n \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result:** Once \\( n \\) reaches 0, `result` holds the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here’s Why We Halve \\( n \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Binary Representation of Exponent\n",
    "Exponentiation by squaring leverages the binary representation of \\( n \\) (e.g., \\( 13 = 1101 \\) in binary). By iterating over the bits of \\( n \\), each bit represents whether to include the current power of \\( x \\) in the result. Halving \\( n \\) in each step (equivalent to right-shifting in binary) effectively moves us through the bits of \\( n \\) from the least significant to the most significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Efficient Power Calculation\n",
    "Each time we square `current_product`, we double the power it represents. By halving \\( n \\), we determine if that power is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If \\( n \\) is odd**, we multiply `result` by `current_product` to \"include\" this power of \\( x \\).\n",
    "- **If \\( n \\) is even**, we skip this multiplication but still square `current_product`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduction strategy minimizes the number of multiplications. Instead of computing \\( x^n \\) directly with \\( n \\) multiplications, we achieve it in \\( O(\\log n) \\) steps by squaring and halving \\( n \\) in each loop iteration.\n"

    "\n",
    "Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **iterative** approach can also be used to find the kth smallest element in a Binary Search Tree (BST) by performing an in-order traversal using a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach** <br>\n",
    "Use a Stack for In-Order Traversal:<br>\n",
    "Instead of recursion, use a stack to manually perform an in-order traversal (left, root, right).\n",
    "Push nodes onto the stack as you go down the leftmost path.\n",
    "Process Nodes in Ascending Order:<br>\n",
    "Pop nodes from the stack one by one, which gives nodes in ascending order.\n",
    "Increment a counter each time a node is popped. When the counter reaches k, the current node’s value is the kth smallest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a way to break down and remember the conditions for an iterative in-order traversal (left, root, right) using a stack in a binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the 'while stack or current Condition' <br>\n",
    "This main while loop ensures that you continue processing nodes as long as there are nodes either:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the left path (tracked by current), or\n",
    "- Remaining in the stack (for nodes we’ve already visited and need to revisit to process their right subtrees).\n",
    "Purpose: Ensures that every node in the tree is visited.\n",
    "Think of this loop as \"Do I have any unprocessed nodes left?\" — either by having a current node to go deeper, or by having nodes left in the stack to pop and process.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Inner while current Loop: Go Left First\n",
    "The inner loop, while current, ensures we travel to the leftmost node of each subtree. By moving as far left as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We add each node to the stack along the way, so that when we finally hit a None on the left, we can backtrack up.\n",
    "This part of the traversal is key to getting nodes in ascending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You first exhaust the left side of each node, ensuring leftmost nodes are processed before the root or right nodes.\n",

    "To help remember, here’s a mental breakdown for each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps for Iterative In-Order Traversal:\n",
    "1. Set Up Traversal Condition: while stack or current\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation: \"Do I have nodes left to process?\"\n",
    "- Purpose: Ensures that every node in the tree is visited.\n",
    "2. Move Left Until None: while current\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation: \"Go as far left as you can.\"\n",
    "- Purpose: Visit nodes in the correct order by reaching the leftmost node first.\n",
    "- Memory Aid: “Left nodes come first in in-order traversal.”\n",
    "3. Process Nodes in the Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pop a node from the stack (this will be the leftmost or the next node in ascending order).\n",
    "- Visit this node (e.g., increment your count or record its value).\n",
    "- If it has a right child, repeat the process by going as far left as possible again with the right child.\n"

    "# Main Concepts of Graph Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "The **main concepts of graph theory** are foundational for many applications in computer science and engineering, including networks, scheduling, and optimization. MIT’s curriculum in graph theory typically emphasizes both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical algorithms** for solving problems. Let’s go over the core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Graph Representation\n",
    "   - **Graph Basics**: A graph is a collection of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**. Graphs can represent various things: road networks, social connections, dependencies, etc.\n",
    "   - **Types of Graphs**:\n",
    "      - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction; they simply connect two nodes.\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "     A --- B\n",
    "      \\\\   /\n",
    "       C\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "      - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have direction, going from one node to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```  \n",
    "               A → B\n",
    "               ↑\n",
    "               C → D\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "      - **Weighted Graph**: Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it, useful for representing distances, costs, etc.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            ``` A --5-- B\n",
    "               \\      /\n",
    "               2\\    /3\n",
    "               \\  /\n",
    "                  C \n",
    "                   ```\n",
    "      - **Unweighted Graph**: All edges have equal weight (or no weight at all).\n",
    "      - **Connected Graph**: There’s a path between every pair of nodes.\n",
    "               \n",
    "                ```\n",
    "               A --- B\n",
    "               \\   /\n",
    "                  C --- D\n",
    "                   ```\n",
    "      - **Disconnected Graph**: Some nodes are unreachable from others.\n",
    "              \n",
    "               ```\n",
    "              A --- B     E --- F\n",
    "               \\   /       \\   /\n",
    "                  C           G\n",
    "               ```\n",
    "   - **Graph Representations**:\n",
    "      - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D matrix where each cell `(i, j)` represents an edge between vertices `i` and `j`. This is space-efficient for dense graphs but can be wasteful for sparse graphs.\n",
    "      - **Adjacency List**: A list of lists or dictionaries where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices. This is space-efficient for sparse graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Traversals (Exploring Graphs)\n",
    "   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:\n",
    "      - Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "      - Implemented using recursion or a stack.\n",
    "      - Used for applications like finding connected components, cycle detection, topological sorting, and solving maze-like problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "      - Explores all neighbors at the present \"depth\" before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "      - Implemented using a queue.\n",
    "      - Commonly used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, level-order traversal, and checking bipartiteness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Graph Properties and Structures\n",
    "   - **Paths and Cycles**:\n",
    "      - **Path**: A sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.\n",
    "      - **Simple Path**: A path with no repeated vertices.\n",
    "      - **Cycle**: A path where the first and last vertices are the same.\n",
    "      - **Acyclic Graph**: A graph with no cycles, important in many applications such as scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Connectivity**:\n",
    "      - A graph is **connected** if there’s a path between any two vertices.\n",
    "      - In directed graphs, **strongly connected** means there’s a path between every pair of vertices in both directions.\n",
    "      - **Connected Components**: Maximal sets of connected vertices in a graph, useful in clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Tree Structures\n",
    "   - **Trees**: A tree is a connected, acyclic undirected graph. It has `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n",
    "   - **Spanning Tree**: A subset of a graph that includes all vertices with minimal edges, forming a tree. Spanning trees are important in network design.\n",
    "   - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A spanning tree with the minimum total edge weight. MST algorithms, like Kruskal’s and Prim’s, are essential for optimizing networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Graph Algorithms\n",
    "   - **Shortest Path Algorithms**:\n",
    "      - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "      - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths even with negative edge weights, detecting negative cycles.\n",
    "      - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, typically used for dense graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms**:\n",
    "      - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Builds the MST by adding the smallest edges that don’t form a cycle.\n",
    "      - **Prim’s Algorithm**: Starts from a single node and grows the MST by adding the minimum weight edge from the tree to a new vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Topological Sorting**:\n",
    "      - Ordering vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) so that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, `u` appears before `v`.\n",
    "      - Used in scheduling tasks, dependency resolution, and course prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Graph Coloring**:\n",
    "      - Assigning colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n",
    "      - Applications include scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and solving puzzles like Sudoku.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Network Flow**:\n",
    "      - **Maximum Flow Problem**: Determines the maximum possible flow in a network from a source to a sink.\n",
    "      - Algorithms like **Ford-Fulkerson** and **Edmonds-Karp** are commonly used for network flow problems, applied in logistics, transportation, and telecommunications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Advanced Topics\n",
    "   - **Eulerian and Hamiltonian Paths**:\n",
    "      - **Eulerian Path**: A path that visits every edge exactly once. Exists if exactly two vertices have an odd degree.\n",
    "      - **Hamiltonian Path**: A path that visits every vertex exactly once, much harder to find and often solved using heuristics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**:\n",
    "      - In a directed graph, SCCs are maximal subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the subgraph.\n",
    "      - **Kosaraju’s Algorithm** or **Tarjan’s Algorithm** can efficiently find SCCs, used in analyzing social networks and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Graph Matching**:\n",
    "      - **Matching**: A set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex. Used in pairing problems like assigning jobs to applicants.\n",
    "      - **Maximum Matching**: The largest possible matching, found using algorithms like the **Hungarian Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Complexity and Optimization\n",
    "   - **Big-O Analysis**: Understanding the time and space complexity of graph algorithms is essential, especially for large graphs.\n",
    "   - **Heuristics**: Approximation techniques for NP-hard graph problems (like Traveling Salesman Problem or finding Hamiltonian cycles).\n",
    "   - **Approximation Algorithms and Greedy Techniques**: Often used in optimization problems where exact solutions are computationally impractical."
